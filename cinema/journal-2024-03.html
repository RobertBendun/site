				<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)</h3>
				<p>Really fun family movie that for one moment slides into Adam Sandler comedy?
				I don't know, writers think that Sonic is for children and we have some fun for adults?
				Really weird.</p>

				<p>I really like how the lore from the games is mixed up into the movie,
				the end result is really smooth and natural.
				Inspiration for all adaptations of comics or games, the mix is excellent.</p>

				<h3>The Adam Project (2022)</h3>
				<p>I watched this movie for a performance of Walker Scobell,
				since one of the reviews of new Percy Jackson TV show mention that he was more Percy in this movie then in the TV series.
				And I agree, not only he is better Percy, he is one of the best child actors I have ever seen.
				At the age of 12 years old he not only kept with Ryan Reynolds, but kept with Reynolds that has been playing the same role that he only plays.
				Truly impressive!</p>
				<p>The movie was suprisingly heartwarming, it's a chill action movie that makes you smile.
				I also really like the dynamic of Mark Ruffalo and Reynolds, I hope to see some of that in a MCU.</p>

				<h3>Heart of Stone (2023)</h3>
				<p>Fake hacking is geting good.
				We have VSCode, nmap, traceroute, MySQL (kinda meaningful!), nmap with some Python action and even some libraries I didn't know like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/geoip2/">geoip2</a>, love it!
				Unfortunatelly they don't really keep the role of terminal and text editors seperate but still impressive!</p>
				<p>Funny is seeing this movie in the same year that Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was released,
				with a similar concept but with infiniatelly better execution.
				This movie Unfortunatelly has nothing for it which makes me sad.</p>
				<p>Also this movie has this feel of potential franchize establishment, bleh.</p>

				<h3>Keeping Up with the Joneses (2016)</h3>
				<p>Movie in which Gal Gadot works? I'm suprised!
				Your standard, generic, boring spy comedy, nothing especially good or bad.
				Also it's always nice to see Zach Galifianakis in something that isn't Kac Vegas.</p>

			<section id="speed">
				<h3>Speed (1994)</h3>
				<p>I wasn't sold on premise when I read the movie description, but I was wrong.
				This movie is action packed, thrilling with good acting from Keanu Reeves!
				Seriously, after watching John Wick series, going back to Keanu speaking normally is refreshing.
				He is such a young sweetie in this movie, love him.</p>
				<p>This really is a classic action movie, with great stunt work and fast-paced script.</p>
