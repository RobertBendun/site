			<h1>Arlechino backstroy animation thoughts</h1>
			<p>Written <time>2024-04-17</time>, a 3 minute read.</p>

			<p>Hoyo dropped today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN5JACOEJFM">really nice animation</a> showing us the backstory of Arlechino
			in her raise to the 4th Harbinger position in Fatui.
			I have a few small thoughts that I wanted to share on that - Fontaine really sunk me in Genshin lore and Arlechino gets us to this nice mystery atmosphere
			that we had in Fontaine Archon Quest.
			Hoyo really knows how to addict us to their characters and this great animation is a large part of that.</p>

			<p>Sidenote: small Arlecchino is one of the cutest in Genshin, rivaling tiny Ganyu and Qiqi.</p>

			<h2>"Father"</h2>

			<p>One of the most exciting bits of lore that this animation gives is the origin of one of the main titles of Arlechino: the Father.
			Previously I imagined it as ceremonial/traditional one, that was just how the things are in the House of the Hearth but it is much better.
			"Father" is an explicit rejection of the "Mother" - previous Knave, previous director of the House.
			The previous director, Crucabena, used this title as one of the indoctrination techniques - she wanted the appearance that we associate with the word "mother":
			love, care, softness and understanding to hide her cruel nature and her brutal actions.</p>

			<p>Arlechino rejects the brutal conditions of her childhood by becoming "strict, unfeeling father". She reproduces the same mechanism of the title as a deception,
			but this time, the lie hides her love for the children and rejection of the previous brutality.
			She takes the form that society expects from her and utilizes it to hide her true nature and protect the children from the violence that she once was victim of.</p>

			<h2>Arlecchino curse</h2>

			<p>I probably should read <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Perinheri">Perinheri</a> before making predictions somewhat based on what I heard is in that book.
			I see a few options for the Arlecchino curse, with this three as my favourites (which doesn't mean that I see them as the most probable):
			<ul>
				<li>Dottore got to the notes of Neirezekreust Ordo and performed some kind of procedure similar to Caterpillar one</li>

				<li>Arlecchino curse is an artifact of her dragon origins.
					She may be the descendant of the Nibelung, the Dragon King that brought the forbidden knowledge from outside this world.
					This excites me the most, since it involves the dragons, Teyvat origins lore and maybe expands the nature of curses in this world.</li>

				<li>Arlecchino is out of this world with some kind of weak connection to Honkai Impact lore.
					Her outfit in weekly boss battle really reminds me of the battle suits in design from Honkai.
					Unfortunately I know too little about Honkai to make further predictions.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Clervie</h2>

			<p>Probably the best friend or soulmate of Arlecchino.
			I belive that we would get more of her in 4.6, maybe not as character that is directly involved in the story, but mentioned one.
			She not only is presented in this animation, but also is on the <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/f/fe/Version_4.6_Preview_Page_Announcement.png">Version 4.6 preview page announcement</a>.</p>

			<p>My best guess is the time manipulation shenanigans that we see in the gameplay trailer of Remuria ruins.</p>
