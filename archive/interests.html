			<p>This is a <a href="https://slashpages.net/">slash page</a> about my interests.
			You can see others in <a href="https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/">/interests directory</a>.</p>

			<h2>Computer science</h2>

			<p>Generally I like to explore my interests horizontally, which makes me obsessed with bunch of different aspects of computer science.
			I enjoy it all, from the close to the metal osdev to the high level webdev.
			However, if I must point topic that is the most captivating: programming languages,
			the art of creating the perfect medium that allows translation of your thoughts to actions.</p>

			<h2>Art</h2>

			<p>I have quite wide definition of art, which I embrace in following fields:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>philosophy,</li>
				<li>fashion,</li>
				<li>recreational math and programming,</li>
				<li>media literacy and reviews.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The joy in pursuit of pure forms and experiences is what draws me to all of them.
			I view myself as a more artistic then scientific person, despite my more analytical brain.
			And this is reflected in how I'm driven to the people that embrace kindness and creativity.
			The pure joy of freedom in creation is hard to replace.</p>

			<p>I blame this interest on the Matrix tetralogy.</p>

			<h2>Cooking</h2>

			<p>I don't like to eat alone and I don't like to cook for myself.
			Cooking for others is a form of expression with pretty clear requirements.
			You must know thyself and others to provide the best meals.
			Additionally it is the perfect excuse to give yourself a moment in the real world,
			without the screens, distractions and noise.
			Only you and your work.</p>

			<h2>Silly adventures</h2>

			<p>One must challenge oneself from time to time.
			Finding excitement in mundane is a hobby of mine.
			My two huge inspirations are <a href="http://tom7.org/">Tom Murphy VII</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GeoWizard">GeoWizard</a>.
			One of the ongoing ones are visiting every street in my city (inspired by <a href="http://pac.tom7.org/">Tom 7 Pac Tom</a>) or going to the work by the most means of transport possible.
			One day I would like to have all of the categories on my driving license (I sadly currently only have the "default" one for cars).</p>
