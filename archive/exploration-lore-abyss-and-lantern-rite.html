<h1>Exploration, Lore, Spiral Abyss and Lantern Rite</h1>
<p><time>2024-02-25</time></p>

<p>This post is some rambling about the Genshin Impact.
It's a result of few weeks that I have somewhat free from university duties and as result have a few hours in a week for playing.
It mostly covers 4.4 update.
You can view my <a href="/genshin/characters.html">all characters here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Month with new achivements</h2>

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of 100% completed Mondstad  -->

<p>In this month for the first time since playing Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2005) I found in myself a desire to 100% a game.
This lead to my first 100% completions of regions in Mondstad.
<time>2024-02-24</time> I completed the last one - Stormterror Liar aka Brightcrown Mountains.
I'm somewhat proud - it represents my ever-increasing knowledge of the game at the game and deepening attachement caused by my growing passion towards the lore.
</p>

<p>Speaking of achivements - my first Spiral Abyss floor 12 completion.
To be honest not so proud of this one, as I only gathered only 1 start for the whole floor for fight with Aeonblight Drake, the weakest boss in game in my opinion.
His attack patterns as so easy that any bow character with decent DPS could get him with ease.
</p>

<h2>Narzissenkreuz Ordo and my love for Genshin Lore</h2>

<!-- TODO: Photo from Narzissenkreuz headquoaters -->

<p>The first spark that ignited my love for Genshin lore was time in the Chasm with Dainslef.
Then we got the Sumeru Archon Quest with reality-bending motives of dreams and samsaras.
Fontaine was a lot more personal, but still lore heavy with one of the best world quest series that I remember - Narzissenkreuz Ordo story line.</p>

<p>Narzissenkreuz Ordo quests mix some of my favourite motives in story telling, making me feel like playing Matrix look-alike.
Add to this major lore bombs and you have recipe for the best world quests in the game.
I love fontainian architecture and with my favourite place beeing Ordo meeting room, with doomsday clock in a ceeling and lovely stained glass window.</p>

<h2>Lantern Rite 2024</h2>

<p>This is my second Lantern Rite, and I'm feeling quite old since so many of the characters that I would love to see are missing from the celebration to make a room for new ones (I hate you Hoyo for another year without Beidou and Ninguang together).
But not all was lost for me since the epilog in form of Fontainians visiting Liyue was hilarious and full of heart.
Especially Zhongli hiding from Neuvillete and beeing roasted by Hu Tao.
Also Furina would be in all events if I would be in charge.
</p>

<p>As of Lantern Rite story, it was more of a Gaming story quest with Lantern Rite theme.
It was good (and with Xianyun/Cloud Retainer funny and full of heart), but lost me a bit with a bit too simple fix of father-son relation.
Zhongli was absolutely superb in his part of the story, but rest of characters actions were questionable at least.
Gaming should have been allowed to resolve matters with his father in more personal manner.
Despite this the ending is top-notch, and their reunion justied.
</p>

<p><em>Side note</em>: I find it funny that Keqing despite having Lantern Rite outfit didn't appear in it, probably to raise sales of Shenhe and Ganyu.</p>

<h2>New characters: Xianyun and Gaming</h2>

<!-- TODO: Xianyun story quest photo -->

<p>Currently I'm focusing on building supports, so I don't plan on using new characters in immidiate future.
For now I see Xianyun as very niche character, requiring a lot of setup to function in any form while Gaming
is a very fun Pyro DPS without strong requirements on his team.
This impression is only from what I tested in trials, maybe when I build them and have power to compose teams my opinion would change.
For now Xianyun only as exploration helper and Gaming joins a long waitlist of characters that I want to build.
</p>

<p>Speaking of characters my new favourite combo is Qiqi and Furina (used to defeat floor 12 for the first time!).
I always liked characters that are hated in community (Physical DPS Amber was my main for some time) and
seeing that Qiqi is quite good now with Furina or Ninguangg with Navia makes me really happy.</p>

<h3>Xianyun Story Quest</h3>

<p>Xianyun Story Quest is one of my favourites.
Genshin is at is best when doesn't hide from the topics of death, mortality and alienation.
Also if treating Lumine as a self-insert character I absolutely would spend days with Cloud Ratainer due to her
personality and technical skills.</p>

<h2>Receiver of Friends From Afar</h2>

<p>
The event for second phase of update is based around my favourite underrated mechanic in Genshin - cooking.
We guest ansamble of characters from all other nations (it would be perfect occasion to host Beidou - Ninguangg date, just saying).
We encounter the Lyney, Lynette, Freminet from Fontaine, Faruzan, Layla, Dori from Sumeru, Itto, Kuki Shinobu and Ayato from Inazuma
