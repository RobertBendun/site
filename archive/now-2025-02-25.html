			<h1>Now (February 2025)</h1>
			<p><time datetime="2025-02-25T00:04:32+01:00">2025-02-25</time></p>

			<p>My life has a lot going on recently so I decided that I have a good reason to create my first <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank">now</a> page - to snapshot what's going on and why this website lost some momentum.</p>

			<p>In October 2024 I started my teaching career (that was my dream for a <em>long</em> time).
			With one class in the previous semester, now I have 3!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Algorithmic composition (2 groups)</li>
				<li>Introduction to programming (for musicians)</li>
				<li>Programming in C</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I love how these turned up, creating materials for my classes and the process of teaching is just wonderful.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>

			<p>My longest still active project, <a href="https://github.com/RobertBendun/harmonia">Harmonia</a> is so close to the 1.0 release.
			Main motivation is first concert performed using it (poster below) which (besides one technical issue) worked wonderfully.
			Receiving congratulations and public appreciation is sure a nice feeling.
			I just need to improve one minor annoyance that keeps me from 1.0 - inability to refresh network interfaces which Harmonia uses.</p>

			<p>Next two issues that would be nice could also be squeezed before 1.0, since they improve the main feature - MIDI synchronized play.
			I need to think about it more, but they seem quite reachable - ability to play MIDI track inanimately and running multiple MIDI files at once.</p>

			<p>I'm also involved with <a href="https://github.com/pozalinia">POZa LiniÄ…</a> magazine, making (both in design and in implementation department) their website.</p>

			<h2>Tech</h2>

			<p>I started using <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">git worktrees</a> in work.
			They seem quite nice, especially when you have multiple somewhat similar but different versions and remotes that you need to concurrently work on.</p>

			<p>I lend an iPad from my girlfriend and I'm starting to warm up to the idea of tablets.
			I was always sceptical as they seem too close to smartphones (which are useless) to be useful.
			I was however wrong - they are great for displaying PDF pages as you work on notes for students (ANSI C is the Bible of C language and one's must forward it's word)
			or during a business meeting when you need to quickly visualize your thought (some kind of pencil required).</p>

			<h2>Recreation</h2>

			<p>My rate of media consumption have fallen quite a bit since the end of last year.
			I partially blame it on the lack of purpose - last year I either wanted to watch as part of sitcom challenge or I wanted to maintain high statistics per month.
			With both gone and lot of other activities I just don't go.
			Still thinking about The Brutalist, maybe I will go and watch it again.</p>
