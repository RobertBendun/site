			<h1>What I Watched in January</h1>

			<p><time datetime="2025-02-13T22:37:45+01:00">2025-02-13</time></p>

			<p>Idea for this year movie blogging is inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KarstenRunquist">Karsten Runquist</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Charlie's Angels!</strong>
			Suprisingly that's really it for movies - after over 80 movies that I watched (and reviewed) last year I just needed a break
			to focus on other things.
			That's why I decided to give a chance for some light action comedy.
			As a consitent Jason Statham watcher I also needed change of pace - that's where Charlie's Angels and the sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle where <em>perfect</em>.
			I didn't ditch well seasoned cinema however - I also watched the first season of <strong>The Bear</strong>.</p>

			<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Movie">
				<h2 itemprop="name">Charlies Angels (2000) and<br> Charlies Angels: Full Throttle (2003)</h2>
				<p style="font-style: italic">I wish that it would get Fast &amp; Furious treatment with long running series that it's allowed to try to reinvent itself every couple episodes.</p>

				<p>Turns out this movies have quite a reputation!
				I've seen it named a „Queer Feminist Cult Classic” or „Surprisingly Feminist”.
				I'm more sceptical, however I've still had a lot of fun watching this movies.
				There were so light and silly, a perfect opposition to the over the top action cinema that is the standard.</p>

				<p>What stayed with me after watching them is the soundtrack.
				Growing out with Need For Speed: Most Wanted I felt right at home.
				After a month I'm still going back to it.
				Highly recommended!</p>

				<p>As for feminist or queer aspect of this movie, from today's perspective its quite lacking.
				Not that we have great feminist and queer cinema today, sadly.
				My main concern for me is that Charlies Angels still views woman as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)">Other</a>.
				Maybe I have to high standard - after all today's Hollywood still feels sometimes backwards to Charlie's Angels with the lack of woman in action cinema.</p>
				<p>My new conspiracy theory: Atomic Blonde (2017) is <span style="letter-spacing: 0.5ch">spiritually</span> Furious 7 of Charlies Angels franchise.</p>

				<p style="font-style: italic">The most impressive long take that I have ever seen.
				Left me speechless.</p>
