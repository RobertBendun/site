<h1>Website update!</h1>

<p><time>2024-02-26</time></p>

<p>I was stuck in a loop.
I wanted new version to be perfect, multilingual, with all of the gizmos and frippery backend (obviously in Rust).
At each iteration behind the scenes I quickly lost interest beacuse I didn't want to write a website engine,
I wanted to write the content but started at automation to my demise.
And it's not like I hate writing HTML or CSS, I don't like repeatition so didn't want to copy and paste headers from one place to another.</p>

<h2>Coming out: I like HTML and CSS</h2>

<p>Internet loves to make fun of web devs and the technologies that they are using.
Despite beeing more of a system-level programming person I never felt like it was justified.
And I like this part of the web, I think that JavaScript is making it worse and HTML and CSS are the good parts.
I understand that they may be hard to work with if you want to create pixel-perfect designs, but at this point you are trying to use
the technology incorrectly.
They are structured documents primarly, and layout systems secondarily (if even).
I wait until web dev redisovers writing custom layout engines using canvas and WebGL.</p>

<h3>Manual until it hurts</h3>

<p>Just write some HTML!
Is that simple.
No need for fancy static site generators or CMS.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>My biggest pain point with just writing HTML was accessibility for potential non-English readers.
Especially one my friend that is isolated from my writing when it isn't in Polish.
I always have this thought that with custom HTTP Server I could somehow created the perfect experience for both languages.
Seeing that none of my previous attemps were ever put to the internet, I failed at that.
For now I will mostly write in English since that is the language that I primary use for computer science and media analysis.
I hope that some of the writing would also be in Polish.</p>

<h3>Non-linguistic accessibility</h3>

<p>Obviously, this side should be as accesible as just a text file (or more since we have <em>structure</em>).
The main guideline is obviously completion with web standards.
Additionally I want to restrict myself to using only non-structural JavaScript (= no JavaScript generated content),
excluding things like animations.
Disabling JavaScript is a right that I value highly and those readers should have the full content for them.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in accessibility for computers, especially structured data interleaved with normal text using <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.
My dream is that my site can become easy source of data without exporting API points or CSV files.
</p>

<h2>Current convention</h2>

<p>I want to try making this website with some sort of narrative that joins all the parts into semi-coherent structure.
It doesn't needs to be perfect.
I don't want to make just another blog side, I want <em>experience</em>.
Of course it is not ready yet.
It never will be ready.
But I want to tinker on it from time to time, just to have fun in this few moments of spare time.</p>
