				<p>This one programming in ATS video that I need from time to time but couldn't find even if my life would depend on it.
				ATS is basically C with proof system to reason about memory allocations. Wild stuff.</p>

				<p>As certified programming language enjoyer I really need to expand my horizons and drop the usual category of languages for niche ones.
				Using C++, Rust, Python, JavaScript and Haskell in 2024 is just basic.

				<p>I'm so inspired by this one.
				I'm always such a huge fun of personal websites that are trying to provide new expirience while staying mostly with hypertext.
				The radical nature of karlicoss website is not only in the presentation but also in the content - it really feels like you are looking at someone's pure brain dump.</p>

				<p>One thing that suprises me in tech is how little the concept of HTML as the most cross-platform document format is used.

				<p>Their whole miniseries of browser monocultures and the consequences of Chromium dominance resonates so much with me.

				<p>I love the idea of curation, configuration and workflows as forms of creation.
				It reminds me of this sort of generational knowledge that we are ought to share with each other - only now instead of how to chop wood I get to share my Neovim configs.</p>
