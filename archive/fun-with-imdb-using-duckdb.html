			<h1>Fun with IMDb using DuckDB</h1>
			<p>Written <time>2024-03-24</time>, a 5 minute read</p>

			<p>For the past few years I have been <a href="https://github.com/RobertBendun/imdb">developing a script</a> to look at my ratings at IMDb.
			It can summarize them, search trought them, aggragate and display into nice charts.
			Essentialy functionality of MS Access but without the stinky GUI and hackable by Python magic.</p>

			<p>Interest grew, and data based only on ratings export wasn't enough for me.
			The biggest project outside of the main script was <a href="https://github.com/RobertBendun/imdb-series-ratings">charting the distribution of ratings per season</a>, giving me nice source for which seasons to avoid.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Doing this sort of data analysis using Python was always a little bit awkward for me - I'm not a data science person and Pandas or numpy are not my strong suit,
			especially since I always enjoyed SQL and Pythonic solutions were always lacking to what I was doing in just SQL.</p>

			<h2>DuckDB enters the chat</h2>

			<p><a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> is tinkering friendly reimagination of SQLite, beeing small and without need to deploy.
			It expands traditional SQL with tools that are useful for quick data manipulation, that is perfect for exploring the IMDb database.</p>

			<h2>Retriving runtime of series I had watched</h2>

			<p>I will be using <code>ratings.csv</code>, from IMDb export in "Your ratings" page with their non-commercial datasets.
			Launch <code>duckdb filename</code>, where <code>filename</code> is a name of the database that DuckDB will use to store intermidiate data.
			It is not nessesary if you have lots of RAM, but unfortunatelly thats not my situation.</p>

			<h3>Loading data</h3>
			DuckDB can load CSV and TSV files directly, even when they are commpressed or via the URL:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>CREATE TABLE ratings AS FROM './ratings.csv';
CREATE TABLE title_episodes AS
  FROM read_csv('https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.episode.tsv.gz', header=true, nullstr="\N");
CREATE TABLE title_basics AS
  FROM read_csv('https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz', header=true, nullstr="\N", quote=NULL);</code></pre>

			With <code>FROM title_basics;</code> you can quickly inspect the loaded data.

			<h3>Watched series</h3>
			<p>Next I need to find the watch series. To do this I find all series that I have rated episodes and join with rated series:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>SELECT DISTINCT parentTconst
FROM ratings JOIN title_episodes ON ratings.Const = title_episodes.tconst
UNION SELECT Const FROM ratings;</code></pre>

			<p>The unnesesary movies on the list don't matter since we later will use this list in the series only context</p>

			<h3>Finding runtime of series on IMDb</h3>
			<p>We will search through all pairs of (series, episode) and group by series summing up the runtime of each episode.
			The runtime and series name are in `title_basics` table so we need to join it with episode information.</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>SELECT
  ANY_VALUE(bp.primaryTitle) AS "Title",
  to_minutes(CAST(SUM(IFNULL(be.runtimeMinutes, 0)) AS BIGINT)) AS "Runtime"
FROM title_episodes te
  LEFT JOIN  title_basics be ON be.tconst = te.tconst
  INNER JOIN title_basics bp ON bp.tconst = te.parentTconst
GROUP BY te.parentTconst;</code></pre>

<p>One nice thing that is DuckDB specific in script above is usage of <code>to_minutes</code> which will convert runtime in minutes as integers to actual minutes.
This allows DuckDB to display this data after nicely.</p>

			<h3>Runtime of series I may have watched</h3>
			<p>To get final effect we need to just filter the runtime per series with the list of series:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>SELECT
  ANY_VALUE(bp.primaryTitle) AS "Title",
  to_minutes(CAST(SUM(IFNULL(be.runtimeMinutes, 0)) AS BIGINT)) AS "Runtime"
FROM title_episodes te
  LEFT JOIN  title_basics be ON be.tconst = te.tconst
  INNER JOIN title_basics bp ON bp.tconst = te.parentTconst
WHERE te.parentTconst IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT parentTconst
  FROM ratings JOIN title_episodes ON ratings.Const = title_episodes.tconst
  UNION SELECT Const FROM ratings)
GROUP BY te.parentTconst
ORDER BY "Runtime" DESC;</code></pre>

<p>which returns this nice table:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>┌─────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┐

<h2>Closing thougts</h2>

<p>I have been very pleased with DuckDB.
I can do all sorts of IMDb data manipulation that comes to my head without leaving REPL of DuckDB.
This is very nice UX compared to Python and especially my previous attempts to do something this quick in C++ or Rust.</p>

<p>One missing part for me is some basic data visualization, that are easy to do in Python.
I can always call DuckDB from python but that looses this nice REPL hacking expirience.</p>
