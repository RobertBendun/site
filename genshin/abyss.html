			<h2>Version 5 Floor 12 History</h2>

			<h3>5.5 April 2025 - Freeze is quite fun, actually</h3>

			<p>Despite Chasca beeing called by the community a Pyro DPS I really like her in Freeze teams.
			Escoffier premiere would definitely be impactful for this team - currently I either use Kokomi or Qiqi - both are mostly there to ensure high level of Furina Fanfere.
			With Escoffier this team not only would have great levels of Fanfere, more resistance shred and additional source of off-field damage.</p>

			<p>As for Arlecchino team, it's my standard comfy team. I also tried similar Pyro-Geo team with Navia.</p>

			<p>With the current Lay Line Disorder „Characters' Elemental Skill Geo DMG increased by 75%”,
			my Navia reached almost half a million in a single shot!
			My Xianling has a little bit of energy issues and I could optimize my rotations.
			Additionally I plan to grind Fontaine artifact domains in the immediate future: both Golden Troupe (for Chiori, Furina and Navia) and Nighttime Whispers for Navia.</p>

			<p>However, Navia claiming Bennet for the first side made my original plan of using Arlecchino on that side quite difficult.
			I tested Arlecchino, Citlali, Chongyun and Chiori on the second side - they need some more optimization.
			Escoffier premiere will yet again be a solution to easily improve team damage.</p>

			</table>

			<p>I went back to the Arlecchino Melt team that I mentioned before, this time with Clorinde on the first side.
			I really don't like using Ororon in her Overload team - however this time I think the circumstances are quite beneficial - with two Hydro infused chambers giving free Electro-Charges and one appreciating a nice jumper Ororon performs exceptionally well.</p>

			<p>As for Arlecchino Melt with Chongyun I still have bad habit of casting her skill outside of Chongyun skill, reducing the value that he provides.
			More training required, since I really appreciate how this team drags him out of obscurity.
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSe1XOEevw">Thanks Soluna for showing me this team</a> (and for reminding us all about how magical genshin combat can feel).</p>

			<p>The Freeze agenda is quite strong for two patches now (with Hydro oriented Freeze and Chasca Freeze).
			I decided to get Ayaka a chance and I was pretty impressed - even decided to level up her burst to level 9!
			I will definitely go back to Freeze teams with Escoffier release they are quite fun after all.</p>

			<p>As for the first side, this may be one of the strongest teams for current Abyss.
			Maybe not as impressive as guaranteed Vaporizes on the first side,
			it still performs so quickly.
			Clorinde became one of my favourite character's to play - which is not surprising with my overall Fontaine preference.</p>

			<p>Since Ayaka worked so well I tried Hydro focused Freeze team and it worked very well.
			I suspect that Ayaka variant is still stronger but more quirky with the Ayaka Burst positioning.
			As for Arlecchino hypercarry team - I really like Lan Yan, offensive focus shielders (like Lan Yan and Citlali)
			are great, especially this time - when Bennet character infusion with Pyro makes Arlecchino more vulnarable to Tulpa and other Hydro attackers.</p>

			<p>My most recently build characters are Lan Yan and Yun Jin.
			They both are very strong Liyue 4 starts, Lan Yan beeing quite versitile and easy to use while Yun Jin quite the opposite.
			For the last week I use Yun Jin every day - attack speed on Clorinde is so much fun!
			I still getting used to the the Arlecchino Melt with just Citlali, feels very fragile to me.</p>

			<p>I also wanted to give Beidou a shot and the team with her as support did great (especially on Hydro infused sides).
			On the second side I tried to use Ayato and I couldn't came up with any (non-hyperbloom) team that could complete in time.
			Escoffier premiere should fix that I hope.</p>

			<h3>5.5 March 2025 - back to the usual</h3>

			<p>This time elemental restrictions feel particulary harsh.
			The first side with chamber 1 and 3 have a major Hydro requirement in the Lector's and Crab.
			The second side with chamber 2 would feel fine without aggrevate if you can speedrun the first side - two waves into the stalling Perpertulal Array is a crime.
			Another Abyss when fun is questionable.</p>

			<p>As for my teams I started with a few, but couldn't reach 3 stars in each chamber.
			Especially fun was Beidou Melt Plunge on the second side (which is <em>almost</em> working with slight energy issues).
			Eventually I satteled on two rather unusual one's - Chasca Freeze and Arlecchino with subdpses that would match the requirement of chamber 2 - (Electro for Dorrito thanks to Fishl) and 3 (high jump thanks to Chiori).</p>

				</tbody>
			</table>

			<p>I went also with another variant of the first half team, that performed slighly worse but was a lot of fun:</p>
			<table>

					<tr>
						<th>First Half</th>
						<td><img src="icons/Chasca.webp" alt="Chasca"></td>

						<td><img src="icons/Sangonomiya_Kokomi.webp" alt="Sangonomiya_Kokomi"></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<p>I would really love another Hydro subdps that would synergize nicely with Chasca - maybe I should try with this Ayato?
			Team of Chasca, Furina, Qiqi, Ayato is a wonderful sight.
			This is somewhat a historic moment for my account - I had fun playing Freeze team
			(let's skip part when this isn't what people have in mind by freeze teams)!</p>


			<p>The underrated star of this Abyss for me is Kokomi - I loved her in the Freeze and Mono Hydro teams.
			I really wish that Escoffier would bring even more power to her teams (and not get nerfed because of Neuvillette).
			My Kokomi teams are not the strongest but are so pleasant to play.</p>

			<p>As for the second side I was mostly trying to beat it with Clorinde, since she is my newest character.
			While I was still on Gladiator it worked great on the first two chambers but last one was too hard.
			When I got almost as good Whimsy pices then I was finally able to beat all 3 (and with some optimization to other teammates).
			The sustained model of damage gets some getting used to after months of playing Arlecchino.
			I also tried Overload teams with Clorinde - however my lack of Mavuika meant that my Chevreuse teams don't have a good option to climb walls in Chamber 3.</p>

			<p>I also tried Wanderer and he's slowly gets my respect in the Abyss - parhaps thanks to the Furina C1 which makes teams with Bennett a lot stronger.
			I also got a lot better at both this gameplay and this team rotation.</p>

			<p>Also I didn't play Beidou in Abyss that much and she is one of my favourites!
			It was time to bring her in and with Electro DPS focused second side and blessing giving Plunge Damage the answer was clear - presenting Beidou Plunge Melt!</p>

			<h3>5.4 Febuary 2025 - the best Abyss</h3>

			<p>I absolutely love the split of AOE first half and single target focused second half.
			With the added restriction of single target in multiwave on the second half, first chamber this is a well designed abyss with fun restrictions.
			I got to play some teams that I normally wouldn't and I really enjoyed testing some team ideas.
			Sadly, with what we know about next ones the fun is temporary.</p>

			<p>My first clear was with the team below.
			I tried Fishl and Beidou variants first, however with my skill it was too easy to die.
			I love the Fishl, Ororon duo - the energy regeneration is crazy and my Ayato and Kazuha had their bursts always available.</p>

			<p>I had trouble with Sucrose taser sadly on the second chamber, first half.
			I think that's a skill issue, I think that with my artifacts I should be able to clear.
			I want to try more Sucrose teams in the immidiate future.</p>

			<p>This abyss provided my first hyper carry Wanderer clear!
			With him flying and Faruzan providing light grouping it was quite easy to position oneself to deal damage to most opponents.
			If felt <em>much</em> better then Xiao FFX team and note that the other side isn't that well put together (I just wanted to use „Anemo” DPS on both sides, if one can classify Chasca as one), making his clear more notable.</p>

			<p>Knowing that this abyss will be AOE I finally build my Nilou!
			I'm so impressed, my Nilou team just shred the abyss and gave my my first mobile clear!
			And I didn't have to pay much attention to gearing - I just switched my Gilded Dreams artifact from Kuki to Kokomi (and they are pretty bad for both Kokomi and Kuki but I don't have great Elemental Mastery pieces), rest left unchanged.
			Oh and Nilou is on a Dull Sword and with almost nothing invested into talents.
			I really want to build Kirara now and even Collei to see the ceiling of Nilou Bloom teams (without the HP gatcha weapon of course).</p>

			<p>I was also curious how would Citlali Hyperfridge go on the second side - I used Hyperfridge in the past but with Qiqi, who like Citlali provided a little more brainoff survivability.
			Citlali variant felt really similar to Qiqi one, maybe I liked Qiqi a bit more - there is a reason to on field Qiqi in her variant and with Citlali you on-field Nahida, just like in most hyperbloom teams.</p>

			<p>There was one team that sadly still disappointed me.
			On the first two chambers it was fine but against Sualani, on mobile, I couldn't keep up.
			Still, Ayaka is the most regretted character on my account, sadly.</p>

			<p>I also got Clorinde on the previous version and decided that I want to test her during this Abyss.
			She's not quite built - on Glad, with skill on 7 level and burst on 4 with Black Sword that she stole from my Ayato.
			It was enough to get all the stars however.
			I really want to test her here due to the taser friendly lineup.
			I tested two variants and one focused more on taser felt better then more of a hyper carry team - I'm curious if Clorinde doesn't have as high personal damage as other characters for whom I absolutely love it.</p>

			<p>I also tested Overload Clorinde but her unfinished state mixed with the both sides rather hostile towards this archetype meant that it felt quite bad.
			I will definitely test it next Abyss (as well the Aggrevate).
			From what I expirienced in the Overworld on my account Quickbloom with Furina (C1; Clorinde, Furina, Nahida, Yao Yao) makes more sense then Overload.</p>

			<h3>5.3 January 2025 - with fun AOE chamber on Floor 11</h3>

			<p>Using Chasca on the second side felt almost like cheating.
			She just shreads to pieces Natlan bosses, especially through Papilla.</p>
			<p>Arlecchino team felt not that great - I mostly put Chiori there because I like her character,
			however in gameplay she just feels absent since you just swap to her to immediately swap out.
			I would keep trying to improve her build, however my motivation decreases rapidly.
			I should try Mono Geo (especially since I have Itto) with her, however there also she would only be character to swap out.</p>

			<p>Also it's not really fair to just put the responsibility of Chiori.
			My Arle lacks good CRIT DMG circlet (currently on pretty bad crit rate one), and could be much better.
			As always one could always grind more!</p>

			<p><em>Side note</em>: I've tried for the first time Burgeon team in Abyss on Floor 11 first side.
			It's starts with bunch of AOE and the team of Kokomi, Thoma, Nahida and Yao Yao felt <em>nuclear</em>.
			In single target against Cryo Abyss Herald it sadly was just awful, however with enough luck and some more skill I could get all 3 stars - my Navia, Xilonen, Xiangling, Bennet team on second side is strong enough to clear the chamber in 40 seconds that I had remaining after the first chamber - I just need to get better.</p>

			<p>Currently the team of Navia, Xilonen, Xiangling, Bennet feels better then the Navia, Chiori variant.
			This is the only reason that I was considering going for Mavuika - swapping Xiangling for Pyro Archon with Scroll set would make team Navia, Chiori, Mavuika, Bennet feel much better.
			However with Chevreuse and Clorinde in the next phase I want to keep my primos for them.</p>

			<details>
				<summary><h4 style="display: inline">On my girlfriend's account</h4></summary>

				<p>Her first 36 stars! The main difference between our accounts is that I have way more characters (due to some low spending) and she has some characters that I don't - mainly Alheitam, Mualani and Mavuika.</p>

			<h3>5.2 December 2024 - Welcoma Chasca!</h3>

			<h4>After Citlali</h4>

			<p>Not only I got some training on my girlfriend's account, I also got and built Citlali (with Sac Frag and Scroll artifacts)!
			This made my Chasca team <em>much</em> better, as seen with my one continuous 36 star run (with only one death due to distraction)!</p>

			<h4>Before Citlali</h4>

			<p>I should be able to clear this with one continuous run.
			Probably it's a mix of skill issue and partially build characters.
			My Navia despite her heavy usage could definitely see some improvements and my Bennett is on Nobless Oblige (ER%, Pyro DMG%, CRIT) which isn't the best solution for the Furina teams.
			I should go back to Maiden / VV domain.</p>
			<p>With the better builds the teams with whom I get 3 stars on Chamber 2 and 3 (which ware also my original teams for this abyss) should absolutely destroy Chamber 1.
			It was also my first time playing Navia Double Hydro, I was very surprised by how good it is (despite my underperforming characters).</p>

			<p>While trying to figure out the team for my girlfriend's account it got pretty interesting.
			She feels this abyss restrictions much more then me thus we had trouble to complete it to 2 stars per each chamber.</p>

			<p>The solution was to run Hyperbloom on the first side (Zhongli, Nahida, Xingqiu, Kuki Shinobu) with the Burnvape on second side:
			Mualani, Mavuika, Xilonen and Collei. Collei was only level 20, we got her some random Emblem artifacts to make her burst consistently
			and help keep the burning reaaction for the Tenebrous Papilla (which works <em>wonders</em>) and have bow for the Aeonblight Drake.
			Xingqiu was suprisingly good on the first side where his orbitals were enough to break crystals dropped by Holawaqa Ngoubou (Natlan dragon).</p>

			<h3>5.2 November 2024 - First time Xiao user</h3>

			<p>First time using Xiao and straight to Abyss. Pretty good, especially for the unfinished build - still level 80/80 on both weapon and character,
			artifacts also could be better.</p>

			<p>My second team was a bit underwhelming - Beidou shield didn't really do much to protect Arlecchino, which forced me to reset chamber once.
			Perhaps Xilonen team would be better, but I get those 36 stars (at third approach) so it was good enough.</p>

			<h3>5.1 October 2024 - Consecrated Beasts and Geo Shields</h3>

			<h4>First approach (35 stars)</h4>

			<p>High base resistance of Consecrated Beasts scared me off from using Arlecchino.
			For my account this leaves me with Hyperbloom (since Navia is busy on the other side).
			First I used Ayato team but sadly you can feel that his build is quite old.

			<p>I really need to invest properly into good Hyperbloom team - it feels really lacking compared to what I see on YouTube.</p>

			<h4>Second approach (36 stars)</h4>

			<p>Then I got Xilonen and even though she is not build fully yet (skill talent level 6, artifacts around level 16, level 80/80, signature sword at 70/70) you can feel the power.</p>
