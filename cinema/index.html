					<h3>The Promised Land (2023)</h3>

					<p>Classic tale of man that wants to be left alone having to deal with opening himself to found family and fighting with those who distrub his peace.
					Well executed, with baeutiful views and stunningly good acting.</p>

					<p>Also lots of farming and potatoes. Fills the gap left by more romantized last year Peasants.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="the-gentlemen">
					<h3>The Gentlemen (2024)</h3>

					<p>Guy Ritchie delivers again. Theo James as Eddie is major suprise for me since I only knew him from awful the Divergent series.
					Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass is the shining star of this series.
					Additionally the setting, scenography and costumes are gorgeus - especially Susie is always so elegant and well coordinated with her outfits, I fallen in love with her style.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="the-rock">
					<h3>The Rock (1996)</h3>

					<p>It's so avarege that you have feeling that you have seen it before. But! The fan theory about beeing an unofficial Bond legacy mixed with Nicolas Cage and boosted by seeking
					for tropes that we all know from later Michael Bay works makes the expirience less dry and even quite enjoyable sometimes.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="dune2">
					<h3>Dune: Part Two (2024)</h3>
					<p>Let's get the obvious thing out of the way: this movie is a visual masterpiece.
					Watching it in a cinema is true pleasure for the eyes, I was in disbelief that movie can look this good.</p>

					<p>Story wise I have some theory (that may be contradicted by the books, by who cars, I had fun).
					I feel like the movie is structured more as a story with unreliable narrator, that distorts what happened
					to make prophecy fullfilment perfect.
					This solves "contraction" of atheist Chani, that sees but choose to not belive; a Bene Gesserit that had create faith on Arrakis for the prophecy to be fullfilled.
					We either have some kind of seeing the future (boring) or unreliable narrator that distorts the view of the story based on their particular intrest (probably Bene Gesserit creating faith in the viewers).</p>

					<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)</h3>
					<p>Really fun family movie that for one moment slides into Adam Sandler comedy?
					I don't know, writers think that Sonic is for children and we have some fun for adults?
					Really weird.</p>

					<p>I really like how the lore from the games is mixed up into the movie,
					the end result is really smooth and natural.
					Inspiration for all adaptations of comics or games, the mix is excellent.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="adam-project">
					<h3>The Adam Project (2022)</h3>
					<p>I watched this movie for a performance of Walker Scobell,
					since one of the reviews of new Percy Jackson TV show mention that he was more Percy in this movie then in the TV series.
					And I agree, not only he is better Percy, he is one of the best child actors I have ever seen.
					At the age of 12 years old he not only kept with Ryan Reynolds, but kept with Reynolds that has been playing the same role that he only plays.
					Truly impressive!</p>
					<p>The movie was suprisingly heartwarming, it's a chill action movie that makes you smile.
					I also really like the dynamic of Mark Ruffalo and Reynolds, I hope to see some of that in a MCU.</p>

				<section id="heart-of-stone">
					<h3>Heart of Stone (2023)</h3>
					<p>Fake hacking is geting good.
					We have VSCode, nmap, traceroute, MySQL (kinda meaningful!), nmap with some Python action and even some libraries I didn't know like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/geoip2/">geoip2</a>, love it!
					Unfortunatelly they don't really keep the role of terminal and text editors seperate but still impressive!</p>
					<p>Funny is seeing this movie in the same year that Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was released,
					with a similar concept but with infiniatelly better execution.
					This movie Unfortunatelly has nothing for it which makes me sad.</p>
					<p>Also this movie has this feel of potential franchize establishment, bleh.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="keeping-up-with-the-joneses">
					<h3>Keeping Up with the Joneses (2016)</h3>
					<p>Movie in which Gal Gadot works? I'm suprised!
					Your standard, generic, boring spy comedy, nothing especially good or bad.
					Also it's always nice to see Zach Galifianakis in something that isn't Kac Vegas.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="speed">
					<h3>Speed (1994)</h3>
					<p>I wasn't sold on premise when I read the movie description, but I was wrong.
					This movie is action packed, thrilling with good acting from Keanu Reeves!
					Seriously, after watching John Wick series, going back to Keanu speaking normally is refreshing.
					He is such a young sweetie in this movie, love him.</p>
					<p>This really is a classic action movie, with great stunt work and fast-paced script.</p>

				<h3>Dune: Part One (2021)</h3>
				<p>I knew that this movie was good, I have seen it in IMAX in 2021, but I forgot how good it was.
					After rewatch (fortunatelly in cinema as a special event before the release of Part Two) is was
					stunned by what have I seen.
					Words cannot describe how good this movie is.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="godzilla-2">
				<h3>Godzilla II: King of Monsters (2019)</h3>
				<p>I love extended bestiary, ancient humans, Titans as ancient gods.
				A little too much focus on silly human story, but the visuals pay for it.
				This movie is definiatelly a wallpaper mine, a visual masterpiece of an action movie.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="argylle">
				<h3>Argylle (2024)</h3>
				<p>Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) done it better. </p>
				<p>Matthew Vaughn another attempt at spy parody, with much more mixed result then previously.
					It's hard not to compare this movie with much better relative: the first Kingsman.
					Especially since the Kingsman series is referenced through the movie:
						wine barrels in Alfie headquarters like bourbon whiskey barrels in Statesman headquarters,
						emphasis of head smashing,
						Samuel L. Jackson excited about the progress bar.
					Argylle is funny with great casting, but lacks in CGI, structure and creativity.
				</p>
				<p>What makes this movie unique is realization of bookworm dream where reality of the beloved book series mixes into ours.
					Realization of this fantasy is perfect, and is the main source of comedy in this movie.
				</p>
				<p>Watching this movie reminded me of Zack Snyder, where style and visuals were more important then story.
					This is similar work.

				<h3>Hazbin Hotel (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Chaotic, fun, with lovely main couple. I wait for second season, the therapy episodes are my favourites. We need more musicals, especially adult animated ones!</p>
			</section>

			<section id="kick-ass">
				<h3>Kick-Ass (2010)</h3>
				<p>I was avoiding this movie for some time know. I was wrong, it is a quite unique superhero comedy, with a bunch of heart.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="the-grand-tour-sand-job">
				<h3>The Grand Tour: Sand Job (s05e03, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Police? Someone has commited homocide on the grand car adventure formula but doing it excatly the same for last 20 years. I miss Seaman special.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="shazam-fury-of-the-gods">
				<h3>Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)</h3>
				<p>Suprisingly funny and light. Doesn't have as much flaws as I expected it to has.
        My main pain is this movie is Wonder Woman. I don't like Gal Gadot in this role,
        and in this movie she is treaded iRoNicAlY from very sexist perspective. Especially
        in the first part of the movie when the camera gazes over her body and her face is
        not shown like it is CW superhero show and DC didn't gave them rights to show her
        face. Really irritating. Regardless, sometimes fun, simple family movie that doesn't
				bring anything new but is made quite well. Probably I wouldn't watch it again.</p>
				<p>Side note: Shazam and Billy Batson don't have the same personality or even similar one.
					In this movie they don't even try to make it belivable that they are the same person
					beside: look! This body replaced previous one!</p>

				<h3>Upgraded (2024)</h3>
				<p>Generic romantic unfunny comedy.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="the-boy-and-the-heron">
				<h3>The Boy and the Heron (2024)</h3>
				<p>This movie is a personal journey through relationship of the author (and by extension an artist) with one's art using stunning visuals.
				Also parrots are absolutely cute.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="mr-and-mrs-smith">
				<h3>Mr. &and; Mrs. Smith (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Fun romantic commedy with some action and good acting.
				In love with the main cast, story and structure.
				Therapy episode as always are the best.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="the-beekeeper">
				<h3>The Beekeeper (2024)</h3>
				<p>This movie is so interesting. The cultic approach to synthesis of outside of system cop
        with a few bad apples is so interesting. Jason Statham in this movie is not just his usual
        normal-job but killer guy - he is a prophet of a bee ideology that utilizes agents above the
        system to preserve it and throw away bad apples - like bees kill queen when she stops beeing
        good for a hive. The politics of this movie are fascinating, beeing a radical form of
        system preservation, redical centrism of sorts. I love Jason Statham normal jobs are for killing
				people universe.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="percy-jackson">
				<h3>Percy Jackson and the Olympians (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Not a failure, but a dissapointement. Despite the superb casting, the execution is flawed.
        Most of the characters are washed up version or sometimes meme version of themselves -
        Annabeth is mostly Percy future love interest, Ares is pathetic goofball and the only flaw
        in casting - Dionysus is just garbage comedic relief that is played in the same way that
        Jason Mantzoukas plays all his other characters (the damage he has done to TV will not be
				forgiven).</p>

				<p>Writing issues continue to the pacing of the show, which feels like recap of the first book
        that you find on YouTube with generated voice narrating it. The only stakes are when we need
				to make a cliffhanger to the next episode, between it we just wait for something to happen.</p>

				<p>It is not a bad TV series, it's a comfort watch, especially for those that have nostalgia for
        the books (or Percy-Annabeth shippers, she says the word!). It just dissapointing, especially
        for a person like me that loves the adaptations of the works of Neil Gaiman and has seen how
				interesting TV series based on mythology coexisting with our era can be.</p>
