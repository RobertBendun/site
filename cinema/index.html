					<h3>Howl's Moving Castle (2004)</h3>

					<p>Where to seek support where you feeling powerless?
					How to cope with the reality that you have been thrown into?
					Do you deserve to be loved, despite your insecurities?
					At first I didn't see this message, seeing only a fantasy movie with wacky machinery made by a pacifist.
					Now I see.
					And admire.</p>

					<h3>You can't avoid the world</h3>

					<p>Each of the characters in this movie has their own way of hiding away from reality.
					Howl, with a trained persona to hide that he is moment away from breakdown, with his castle, with multiple fronts to move away from choosing a side, hiding from duties, playing with his life to feel anything.
					Sophie, seeing herself as worthless, with only value in her work for others, her only source of validation.
					When they met, they start forming an unusual found family, that would get them back into the world, to feel again, to live again.
					</p>

					<p>The castle, the one that is always moving, running away from the danger, the world doesn't survive the film.
					People that want to stay, want to help, want to share the tough moments - they survive.</p>

					<p>Side note: Christian Bale is English voice for Howl and you can hear that he was shooting Batman Begins nearby.</p>

					<h3>Psych season 3 and 4 (2008-2010)</h3>

					<p>Two seasons with one review, since I don't have much time this month.
					Also the show become too good to stop watching after the season, especially with the ending of the season 3.
					Be sure to read <a href="#psych-s01">season 1</a> and <a href="#psych-s02">season 2</a> reviews.</p>

					<h4>Season 3 Favourites</h4>
					<p>Picking here only a few is hard, since this season is filled with great episodes.
					Creators were knowing what they are doing from the first episodes of season 1 but here they perfected the formula.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>An Evening with Mr. Yang - this funny detective show created the most believable Moriarty type threat for my Sherlock Spencer that I have seen. Impressive.</li>
						<li>Tuesday the 17th - horror parodies are my jam, love how different this episode looks to match the genre they are referencing</li>
						<li>Disco Didn't Die. It Was Murdered! - I love the aesthetic of this episode, 70s are fabulous, especially on Gus</li>
						<li>The Greatest Adventure in the History of Basic Cable - Indiana Jones in your crime show?!</li>
					</ol>

					<h4>Season 4 Favourties</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Shawn Takes a Shot in the Dark - perfect episode, great premise mixed with the usual great sauce of this show: son-father dynamic, romance with Juliet and Lassie insecurity</li>
						<li>You Can't Handle This Episode - John Cena cameo?! 10/10</li>
						<li>Mr. Yin Presents - part 2 of the Yin-Yang series, also great, this time with a tribute to Hitchcock</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Furiosa (2024)</h3>
					<img src="furiosa.webp" alt="">
					<p>Prequels are bound by the chains of time - they happen later for the viewer, but before what we saw.
					And this peculiar relationship with time makes prequels hard for creators and for viewers.
					George Miller, Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth and all creative force that stands behind this movie had job harder then usual - create a prequel to one of the best action movies to ever exist.</p>

					<p>The solution?
					Focus on buildup to the second movie, show us the world, it's inner workings.
					Prepare both Furiosa and the viewer for what's to come in the Mad Max: Fury Road.
					If we needed any more confirmation, Fury Road is put on the screen as ending credit roll, making it feel as smooth continuation from the first one, action packed third act that we are so used to now.</p>

					<p>Furiosa stands perfectly on it's own, however due to weird relationship with time I understand if it may not be for everyone.
					This movie is not perfectly optimized for entertainment, it's a grim revenge story and want's viewer to sometimes feel uneasy.
					There are no heroes in the apocalypse.
					There is no catharsis, no epic ending beyond the stories that one may tell.</p>

					<p>I never suspected to have movies that have structure as Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. And here we are, history repeats but sometimes in wrong order.</p>

					<p>This gets a little bit long but this is not a straightforward movie.
					It feels different, unique, uneasy, fascinating.
					It's one of the movies where you really want to get into directors mind, sit with him and learn why.
					It reminds me of Matrix series (matrices?).</p>

					<p>Anyway, performances.
					Biggest surprise is Chris Hemsworth who I had a little grudge against after Thor: Love and Thunder, shines in this movie.
					After first scenes with him, he fully became Dementus, even when we have visual reminders of Thor like his cape.
					It makes me thing that Hemsworth is really underutilized by his Marvel roles.
					The mix of laughter, horror, mannerisms and bizarreness that Dementus carries on his shoulders stands out.
					Script has a big role here too, despite being sometimes silly antagonist, he feels like a person and at the end you somehow understands him (by all means he is not justified, just well defined and somewhat human in the cruelty of Mad Max world.</p>

					<p>Anya Taylor-Joy is excellent in showing the rage in Furiosa, both when she has it hidden or on display.
					Apparently the actress <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/anya-taylor-joy-fights-female-rage-on-screen-1235906843/">fought for her scream scene</a> and it was worth it.
					Furiosa does not tell much in this movie but whenever she uses her voice it is very deliberate.
					Just a perfect performance, as one would expect.
					</p>


					<p>To sum up, Furiosa is a perfect prequel, a surrealistic preface for a postmodern masterpiece.</p>

				<section id="pretty-little-liars-s01">
					<h3>Pretty Little Liars season 1 (2011)</h3>

					<p>One of the best pilot episode in the history of TV, you are so hooked up to the premise from the start of the show.
					And to my surprise the atmosphere stays for a long time.
					However, the cracks slowly starts to show up and the formula of 22 episodes is a bit long sometimes.
					It may be my fault, watching it at once when it was designed for one episode per week TV release schedule.</p>

					<p>I cannot leave the fashion out of the picture here, it is aesthetic that I grew up it which mixes nostalgia into this lovely picture.
					It's reflected by plenty of fashion analysis video essays on YouTube which I can't wait to watch but restricting myself to not accidentally spoil the mystery.</p>

					<p>Second best thing in this season was sapphic self-discovery of Em, with her relationships.
					From the first moment, her crush of Maya was so cute. The coming out scene to her parents and further struggle of lack of parental support was perfectly portrayed.
					One of the best representations that I have seen on TV.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="psych-s02">
					<h3>Psych season 2 (2007-2008)</h3>

					<p>We get more character development and I love it!
					More of the same good stuff, perfecting current formula.</p>

					<p>My favourite type of sitcom (or sitcom like shows) is the cast that has a plethora of characters to resonate with.
					Psych fulfills this perfectly, giving you relatable and humane moments from all of the cast.
					I'm most of the time mixture of dumb and smart that Shawn represents perfectly or
					naive, trustworthy nature with love for good time, fun and fashion that Juliet has.</p>

					<h4>Favourite episodes</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Lights, Camera... Homicidio - one of the best comedic episodes with nice commentary of toxic fandoms</li>
						<li>Black and Tan: A Crime of Fashion - fashion, style and murder?! Also Gus being hooked up into his model fake identity is my favourite Gus moment for now.</li>
						<li>65 Million Years Off - I love the wacky premise and Shawn's father genuine fear for his son</li>

					<h3>Psych season 1 (2006-2007)</h3>
					<p>So, the next long running series ahead of me (8 seasons!), entering as always with somewhat mid first season.
					For this one I'm excited, since this mid by IMDb rating season was already pretty fun to watch!</p>

					<p>Psych is a Sherlock Holmes inspired TV series where the Sherlock gets to be a little bit goofy.
					This not only makes the series great for casual watch but allows more wacky stories that don't need to take themself such seriously.</p>
					<p>The most promising element for me is the complicated father-son relationship that they slowly cook through the season.
					The main hero, Shawn, has his childhood written all over his adult self and the show really nicely shows that.
					</p>

					<p>I'm watching it mainly due to the title of this video essay: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB6Rk3V296o">Psych: the BEST Sherlock Holmes adaptation in existence</a>".
					I don't know if I want to watch the second season or it first.</p>

					<h3>Favourite episodes</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Scary Sherry: Bianca's Toast - Juliet gets way to much into her undercover identity as sorority girl
						mixed with Halloween episode, great stuff</li>
						<li>He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, He Loves Me, Oops He's Dead - going on a quick dating night may get you killed man</li>
						<li>From the Earth to Starbucks - character building for Lassiter, giving really heartwarming moments for the crew</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>The Fall Guy (2024)</h3>
					<img src="the-fall-guy.webp" alt="">
					<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDKZe8r-DE" target="_blank">I was made for lovin' you, baby, you ware made for lovin' me.
							And I can't get enough of you, baby, can you get enough of me?</a></em>.

					<p>I was THE target for this movie.
					Love story hidden in the self-referential action movie is the definition of fun for me (just like the Matrix babe).
					I knew that I was signing for a fun ride with director behind Atomic Blonde and Hobbs and Shaw but I didn't suspect such a great movie overall.
					The hype generated by the opening is only getting higher through the movie and to my suprise, it gets emotional?!
					There is a scene where Ryan Gosling sits in the car and turns the heart piercing song as loud as it gets to help him expirience his pain - I use the same method to let go and cry which made this scene very personal for me.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another aspect that was superb was self-referentiality and overall love for cinema in this movie.
						Characters were in love in cinema at least as much as I am and so was the creative team behind the movie.
						My favourite references are Scott Pilgrim vs the World-like fight scene (one in the club, shown in the trailers) and
						Emily Blunt entering the John Wick mode, including using stationery as a weapon.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ryan Gosling is also a paragon of masculinity for the XXI century.
						His performance really sells you this man that can both enjoy his stunning stunt work, be proud of it while beeing just a guy who has trouble with expressing his emotions well but doesn't hide from it.
						More movies with him in such roles please!
					</p>
					<p>
						For now this is my favourite action movie of the year.
						But as I said, I was made for lovin' it.

					<h3>The Good Place (2016–2020)</h3>
					<img src="good-place.webp" alt="">
					<p>The blueprint for TV, one of the best shows of all time with <a href="#parks-and-recreation">Parks and Recreation</a> and Community.</p>

					<p>While shows like Bojack Horseman, Community and Parks and Recreation fight more or less indirectly against the loneliness, void and lack of meaning in the world, The Good Place takes this fight eye to eye - and wins!</p>


					<p>It feels a lot like a Philosophy 101, just an entry for the amateur that traverses through the vast lands of Wikipedia but I suppose it is a good thing - this makes it a gateway drug to the world of philosophy, science and appreciation of beauty in life.
					It also carries this refreshing (for a traditional TV) feeling that creator takes the stance for the goodness in the world.
					Great stuff, especially after somewhat detached from the reality Parks and Recreation.</p>

					<p>I think that the journey from the Parks and Recreation to Good Place really emphesise what TV is, and how it helps us. In the words of the greatest TV fan:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>There is skill to it.
						More importantly, it has to be joyful, effortless, fun.
						TV defeats its own purpose when it's pushing an agenda, or trying to defeat other TV or being proud or ashamed of itself for existing.
						It's TV; it's comfort.
						It's a friend you've known so well, and for so long you just let it be with you, and it needs to be okay for it to have a bad day or phone in a day, and it needs to be okay for it to get on a boat with LeVar Burton and never come back.
						Because eventually, it all will.</p>
						<cite>&ndash; Abed Nadir in the finale of Community s06e13 "Emotional Consequences of Broadcast Television"</cite>
					</blockquote>

					<p>The Good Place is that friend. It is here to make you happier, to laugh and cry with you, and finally to make your life a little bit better.
					And that's why I decided to rewatch it, going myself through a hard time and in need of this comfort escape, that paints a beautiful picture of the happiness at the end of the road for all of us.</p>

					<h3>Spirited Away (2001)</h3>
					<img src="spirited-away.webp" alt="">
					<p>Fellas, has your dad forget that he drives your family and rally staged a little bit too close to the sun so that you ended in the spirit world? That's the magic of Audi Quattro.</p>

					<p>A cautionary tale against consumptionism tell through the great medium of animation.
					What to tell about this movie that hasn't been told already?
					One of the most important animations of all time.
					</p>

					<p>One interesting aspect of my personal relation with this movie is that it is deeply uncomfortable for me sometimes.
					I don't know if this is only me, but the beginning of the movie until protagonist gets to the boiler room is a nightmare and I'm always waiting for it to finish.
					</p>


					<p>Watched on the Studio Ghibli Marathon that sadly I couldn't finish, going home after first movie which was Spirited Away.</p>

				<section id="parks-and-recreation">
					<h3>Parks and Recreation (2009–2015)</h3>
					<img src="parks-and-recreation.webp" alt="">

					<p>A comforting blanket and bowl of nice soup on cold day in the middle of a winter.
					Brilliant sitcom filled with charming comedy, quirky and relatable characters,
					full of passion and love for the world and their work.
					It's a nice pallet cleanser after the Office, prooving once again that in the battle against nihilism the love is an answer.</p>

					<p>If I could recommend one TV show that anyone should watch it would be Parks and Rec.
					It's gives you hope, that you can overcome the struggles in life with the strong foundation
					of your found family.</p>

					<p>I should write one day about how similar and different the shows by Michael Schur are.
					Hopefully soon here will be a link to an article about it.</p>

					<h3>Spy x Family: Code White (2023)</h3>
					<p>Movie's based on anime are medium less known to me so my perspective is not well-informed.
					Cute and fun, but more of a special episode then a separate movie.</p>

					<p>Final action scene with Yor boss battle is a bit unnesesary for me,
					and even somewhat dreadfull.
					I'm much more for the family comedy, cutness and laughter mixed with their poorly executed
					attempts at beeing normal family despite lacking any kind of role models.
					The bizzarnes of what they consider normal is the main point of the show and the drawn
					out action sequences work against that.</p>

					Billy Rosewood getting more and more unhinged, ending with this supercop, Rambo or Machete style ending was a lot of fun.
					Especially since it made fun of all of the crap that had yet to come with 90s or Zack Snyder movies.
					So a little bit worse (but just a little!) but visionary?</p>

					<h3>Beverly Hills Cop (1984)</h3>

					<img src="beverly-hills-cop.webp" alt="">

					<p>This movie was so much fun!
					It somehow balanced action movie, comedy movie and somewhat grounded feeling!
					Definitely recommend.</p>

					<p>The relation and banter between Axel (Eddie Murphy), Det. Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), Sgt. Taggart (John Ashton) is so funny and realistic (and according to IMDb mostly improvised).
					Eddie is combines in Axel opposites - universal personal charm and quick wit, able to piss off anyone.
					One of the most believable roles thought all the movies I have watched to this day, superb casting and script choices.</p>

					<p>Another surprise is humor, that is not personal or offending but really charming.
					Especially seeing that this 40 year old movie (birthday at 5th of December) has good queer humor, that could pass in today show targeted for queer audiences by Netflix.
					Astonishing.</p>

					<h3>Kobieta z... (2023)</h3>

					<img src="woman-of.webp" alt="">

					<p>It's hard to review this movie - it's embarrassing that in 2024 it is revolutionary to get basic trans story in Polish cinema.
					Don't get me wrong - it hits hard and personal, but I expected a little bit more.
					In the same time - it's a must watch and could have been a little bit better.</p>

					<p>Despite my little conflict between being very affected by this movie and wanting something more, I was impressed.
					The Polish small town was very lovely, conversations grounded and some scenes very personal and intimate.
					From the craftsmanship standpoint it was almost excellent.</p>

					<p>Another bare minimum that we somehow must see as advantage in 2024 is cameos from trans activits, politicians and celebrities in this movie.
					I hope that we can see more of queer folk in acting roles in Polish cinema in the future.</p>


					<p><em>Side note:</em> coming from Poznań, I was surprised by how much lacking nature the town was.
					I'm really glad that this time in urbanism is mostly behind us.</p>

					<h3>Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)</h3>
					<img src="./lupin-3.webp" alt="">
					<p>The most approachable Hayao Miyazaki movie that I had watched and one of my favorites!
					I love the car chases with the beautiful Fiat 500, I love Lupin with his gadgets, noble thief personality,
					I love Fujiko with her strong woman that is the only force capable to oppose and trick Lupin.</p>

					<p>For me this movie doesn't feel like something from 1979, action and pacing are surprisingly on par with what we have today.</p>

					<h3>Space Force (2020-2022)</h3>
					<img src="space-force.webp" alt="">
					<p>What a sad, boring show.
					From how it was shot and how special effects are it makes me angry that so much work went to such weak script.</p>

					<p>Steve Carell plays washed up version of Michel Scott and sets the washed up tone for the whole series.
					You can't as easy create workplace comedy in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force">U.S. Space Force</a> as in paper company, you can't be apolitical while making fun of ridiculous branch of military and you can just hope that look he makes a funny dance is good comedy.

					<h3>The Office (2005 - 2013)</h3>

					<img src="./the-office-us-jim-dwight.webp" alt="Jim and Dwight from the office sitting together">

					<p>The baseline to judge all other sitcoms, not because it's special but for how in the middle it is.
					It separates good show from the bad ones, with the nice mix of good and bad seasons, arcs and characters.</p>

					<p>It's hard to summarize whole 9 seasons, but one thing is clear: how driving away from boring reality ruined the show.
					The Office is at it's peak when it is trying to find happines in the bleak everyday boringness of office work,
					when characters want to have fun not because the script wants it but because their boredom motivates them to spice up their life.</p>

					<p>No one represents this better then Jim Helpert, a character that trought the series gets washed up into just a cool guy,
					that hangs out with the gang but is better then them. From guy that pranks his colleague to cope with boring reality in sort of
					punch up relation becomes a bully that gives up bullying at the end of the road.</p>

					<h4>Jim and Dwight, heartbreaking but favourite dynamic in the show</h4>

					<p>I really liked how Jim and Dwight represented two side of the same coin - they both think they deserve better then their current role,
					that they are meant for greater things.
					The difference between them is in their acting up on that fact - Jim decides to avoid work as much as possible, relying on how people see him
					and the mythos that he constructs (soft power) while Dwight seeks any possible way to climb corporate ladder and let his work be the best reflection
					of his true self (hard power).</p>

					<p>In this case the final episodes provides a great conclusion when they are more kind and caring to each other while fully maintaining their dynamic.</p>

					<p>I will write more about sitcoms in general soon, just had to finish The Office to get more holistic view on the genre.</p>

					<p>Also this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDJpTSQc6wc">skit from the Emmys</a> is one of the best things that happened ever.</p>

					<p>More of a checklist completion for what constitutes movie from this series then actual creation of the true next chapter.
					Fun movie, but without the strong personal narration and coherence that we loved from the series.
					I'm a bit sad - I feel like they had the right ingredients to make a worthy sequel but just didn't care or didn't commit hard enough.</p>

					<h3>Budda. Dzieciak '98 (2024)</h3>
					<p>It's really hard for me to review this movie - the mojor reason is that this may be my first autobiography that I have seen in cinema.
					Maybe I don't have the background to review this movie in it's category.</p>

					<p>I have very mixed feelings about this movie.
					The personal context nudges me towards more gullible perspective, when this is really an inspiring story that is worth sharing,
					with good structure and only small missteps along the way like with pretencious and pseudo-cautious message about the impact of social media that
					on the one hand can be viewed as needed seeing the average audience age in the movie and on the other hand is an attempt to trick viewer into thinking that this movie has any structure
					basides look how cool and dedicated influencer I am.</p>

					<p>It feels more like a YouTube video then actual movie, somewhat quickly put together from the footage lying around the YouTube channel and it's production leftovers.
					From what I discussed with my friend who is a viewer, the Budda's channel is filled with content that would shine in a movie - adventures, more technical aspects of car centric video production etc.
					After all I wish that they would play some of that instead of the movie that I have watched.

					<h3>Godzilla x Kong (2021)</h3>

					<img src="kong-in-hollow-earth.webp" alt="Kong in hollow earth" />

					<p>I watched this with the sequel at minimaraton event and it was lovely seeing both of this movies together but it has made reviewing them harded due to them mixing in my had together, especially in how similar they are.</p>
					<p>This was a true adventure film, that also had some kaijus in it.
					We have great journey to Hollow Earth, with synthwave music and ships.
					We have ancient structures with alien like technology that stores the magic artifact that is the only way to defeat Godzilla.
					It was like watching good Indiana Jones chapters.</p>

					<p>I love that Kong is the underdog, that can't outperform Godzilla in pure strength and needs to think to keep up.
					And Kong keeps up - we even have Assasin's Creed like assasinations and sneaking from him.
					The monsters have a lot of personality - we seen sorrow, regret, homesickness and generational trauma in Kong.
					Godzilla is more of a side character, this threat that we know that is close and very dangerous and we know their motivation completely - we see the anger, determination and to my suprise mercy for Kong.
					Godzilla doesn't want to kill him, only to assert their dominace - any why they feel the need to do it we have a great expansion in the next movie.</p>

					<p><strong>Grates Batman v Superman adaptation of all time.</strong></p>

					<h3>The Promised Land (2023)</h3>

					<img src="bastarden.webp" alt="Working at the farm from The Promised Land">

					<p>Classic tale of man that wants to be left alone having to deal with opening himself to found family and fighting with those who distrub his peace.
					Well executed, with baeutiful views and stunningly good acting.</p>

					<p>Also lots of farming and potatoes. Fills the gap left by more romantized last year Peasants.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="the-gentlemen">
					<h3>The Gentlemen (2024)</h3>

					<p>Guy Ritchie delivers again. Theo James as Eddie is major suprise for me since I only knew him from awful the Divergent series.
					Kaya Scodelario as Susie Glass is the shining star of this series.
					Additionally the setting, scenography and costumes are gorgeus - especially Susie is always so elegant and well coordinated with her outfits, I fallen in love with her style.</p>

					<h3>The Rock (1996)</h3>

					<p>It's so avarege that you have feeling that you have seen it before. But! The fan theory about beeing an unofficial Bond legacy mixed with Nicolas Cage and boosted by seeking
					for tropes that we all know from later Michael Bay works makes the expirience less dry and even quite enjoyable sometimes.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="dune2">
					<h3>Dune: Part Two (2024)</h3>
					<p>Let's get the obvious thing out of the way: this movie is a visual masterpiece.
					Watching it in a cinema is true pleasure for the eyes, I was in disbelief that movie can look this good.</p>

					<p>Story wise I have some theory (that may be contradicted by the books, by who cars, I had fun).
					I feel like the movie is structured more as a story with unreliable narrator, that distorts what happened
					to make prophecy fullfilment perfect.
					This solves "contraction" of atheist Chani, that sees but choose to not belive; a Bene Gesserit that had create faith on Arrakis for the prophecy to be fullfilled.
					We either have some kind of seeing the future (boring) or unreliable narrator that distorts the view of the story based on their particular intrest (probably Bene Gesserit creating faith in the viewers).</p>

					<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)</h3>
					<p>Really fun family movie that for one moment slides into Adam Sandler comedy?
					I don't know, writers think that Sonic is for children and we have some fun for adults?
					Really weird.</p>

					<p>I really like how the lore from the games is mixed up into the movie,
					the end result is really smooth and natural.
					Inspiration for all adaptations of comics or games, the mix is excellent.</p>

				<section id="adam-project">
					<h3>The Adam Project (2022)</h3>
					<p>I watched this movie for a performance of Walker Scobell,
					since one of the reviews of new Percy Jackson TV show mention that he was more Percy in this movie then in the TV series.
					And I agree, not only he is better Percy, he is one of the best child actors I have ever seen.
					At the age of 12 years old he not only kept with Ryan Reynolds, but kept with Reynolds that has been playing the same role that he only plays.
					Truly impressive!</p>
					<p>The movie was suprisingly heartwarming, it's a chill action movie that makes you smile.
					I also really like the dynamic of Mark Ruffalo and Reynolds, I hope to see some of that in a MCU.</p>

				<section id="heart-of-stone">
					<h3>Heart of Stone (2023)</h3>
					<p>Fake hacking is geting good.
					We have VSCode, nmap, traceroute, MySQL (kinda meaningful!), nmap with some Python action and even some libraries I didn't know like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/geoip2/">geoip2</a>, love it!
					Unfortunatelly they don't really keep the role of terminal and text editors seperate but still impressive!</p>
					<p>Funny is seeing this movie in the same year that Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was released,
					with a similar concept but with infiniatelly better execution.
					This movie Unfortunatelly has nothing for it which makes me sad.</p>
					<p>Also this movie has this feel of potential franchize establishment, bleh.</p>

				<section id="keeping-up-with-the-joneses">
					<h3>Keeping Up with the Joneses (2016)</h3>
					<p>Movie in which Gal Gadot works? I'm suprised!
					Your standard, generic, boring spy comedy, nothing especially good or bad.
					Also it's always nice to see Zach Galifianakis in something that isn't Kac Vegas.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="speed">
					<h3>Speed (1994)</h3>
					<p>I wasn't sold on premise when I read the movie description, but I was wrong.
					This movie is action packed, thrilling with good acting from Keanu Reeves!
					Seriously, after watching John Wick series, going back to Keanu speaking normally is refreshing.
					He is such a young sweetie in this movie, love him.</p>
					<p>This really is a classic action movie, with great stunt work and fast-paced script.</p>

				<h3>Argylle (2024)</h3>
				<p>Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) done it better. </p>
				<p>Matthew Vaughn another attempt at spy parody, with much more mixed result then previously.
					It's hard not to compare this movie with much better relative: the first Kingsman.
					Especially since the Kingsman series is referenced through the movie:
						wine barrels in Alfie headquarters like bourbon whiskey barrels in Statesman headquarters,
						emphasis of head smashing,
						Samuel L. Jackson excited about the progress bar.
					Argylle is funny with great casting, but lacks in CGI, structure and creativity.
				</p>
				<p>What makes this movie unique is realization of bookworm dream where reality of the beloved book series mixes into ours.
					Realization of this fantasy is perfect, and is the main source of comedy in this movie.
				</p>
				<p>Watching this movie reminded me of Zack Snyder, where style and visuals were more important then story.
					This is similar work.

				<h3>Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)</h3>
				<p>Suprisingly funny and light. Doesn't have as much flaws as I expected it to has.
        My main pain is this movie is Wonder Woman. I don't like Gal Gadot in this role,
        and in this movie she is treaded iRoNicAlY from very sexist perspective. Especially
        in the first part of the movie when the camera gazes over her body and her face is
        not shown like it is CW superhero show and DC didn't gave them rights to show her
        face. Really irritating. Regardless, sometimes fun, simple family movie that doesn't
				bring anything new but is made quite well. Probably I wouldn't watch it again.</p>
				<p>Side note: Shazam and Billy Batson don't have the same personality or even similar one.
					In this movie they don't even try to make it belivable that they are the same person
					beside: look! This body replaced previous one!</p>

				<h3>The Beekeeper (2024)</h3>
				<p>This movie is so interesting. The cultic approach to synthesis of outside of system cop
        with a few bad apples is so interesting. Jason Statham in this movie is not just his usual
        normal-job but killer guy - he is a prophet of a bee ideology that utilizes agents above the
        system to preserve it and throw away bad apples - like bees kill queen when she stops beeing
        good for a hive. The politics of this movie are fascinating, beeing a radical form of
        system preservation, redical centrism of sorts. I love Jason Statham normal jobs are for killing
				people universe.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="percy-jackson">
				<h3>Percy Jackson and the Olympians (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Not a failure, but a dissapointement. Despite the superb casting, the execution is flawed.
        Most of the characters are washed up version or sometimes meme version of themselves -
        Annabeth is mostly Percy future love interest, Ares is pathetic goofball and the only flaw
        in casting - Dionysus is just garbage comedic relief that is played in the same way that
        Jason Mantzoukas plays all his other characters (the damage he has done to TV will not be
				forgiven).</p>

				<p>Writing issues continue to the pacing of the show, which feels like recap of the first book
        that you find on YouTube with generated voice narrating it. The only stakes are when we need
				to make a cliffhanger to the next episode, between it we just wait for something to happen.</p>

				<p>It is not a bad TV series, it's a comfort watch, especially for those that have nostalgia for
        the books (or Percy-Annabeth shippers, she says the word!). It just dissapointing, especially
        for a person like me that loves the adaptations of the works of Neil Gaiman and has seen how
				interesting TV series based on mythology coexisting with our era can be.</p>
