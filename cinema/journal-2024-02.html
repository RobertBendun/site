				<h3>Dune: Part One (2021)</h3>
				<p>I knew that this movie was good, I have seen it in IMAX in 2021, but I forgot how good it was.
					After rewatch (fortunatelly in cinema as a special event before the release of Part Two) is was
					stunned by what have I seen.
					Words cannot describe how good this movie is.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="godzilla-2">
				<h3>Godzilla II: King of Monsters (2019)</h3>
				<p>I love extended bestiary, ancient humans, Titans as ancient gods.
				A little too much focus on silly human story, but the visuals pay for it.
				This movie is definiatelly a wallpaper mine, a visual masterpiece of an action movie.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="argylle">
				<h3>Argylle (2024)</h3>
				<p>Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) done it better. </p>
				<p>Matthew Vaughn another attempt at spy parody, with much more mixed result then previously.
					It's hard not to compare this movie with much better relative: the first Kingsman.
					Especially since the Kingsman series is referenced through the movie:
						wine barrels in Alfie headquarters like bourbon whiskey barrels in Statesman headquarters,
						emphasis of head smashing,
						Samuel L. Jackson excited about the progress bar.
					Argylle is funny with great casting, but lacks in CGI, structure and creativity.
				</p>
				<p>What makes this movie unique is realization of bookworm dream where reality of the beloved book series mixes into ours.
					Realization of this fantasy is perfect, and is the main source of comedy in this movie.
				</p>
				<p>Watching this movie reminded me of Zack Snyder, where style and visuals were more important then story.
					This is similar work.

				<h3>Hazbin Hotel (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Chaotic, fun, with lovely main couple. I wait for second season, the therapy episodes are my favourites. We need more musicals, especially adult animated ones!</p>
			</section>

			<section id="kick-ass">
				<h3>Kick-Ass (2010)</h3>
				<p>I was avoiding this movie for some time know. I was wrong, it is a quite unique superhero comedy, with a bunch of heart.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="the-grand-tour-sand-job">
				<h3>The Grand Tour: Sand Job (s05e03, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Police? Someone has commited homocide on the grand car adventure formula but doing it excatly the same for last 20 years. I miss Seaman special.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="shazam-fury-of-the-gods">
				<h3>Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)</h3>
				<p>Suprisingly funny and light. Doesn't have as much flaws as I expected it to has.
        My main pain is this movie is Wonder Woman. I don't like Gal Gadot in this role,
        and in this movie she is treaded iRoNicAlY from very sexist perspective. Especially
        in the first part of the movie when the camera gazes over her body and her face is
        not shown like it is CW superhero show and DC didn't gave them rights to show her
        face. Really irritating. Regardless, sometimes fun, simple family movie that doesn't
				bring anything new but is made quite well. Probably I wouldn't watch it again.</p>
				<p>Side note: Shazam and Billy Batson don't have the same personality or even similar one.
					In this movie they don't even try to make it belivable that they are the same person
					beside: look! This body replaced previous one!</p>

				<h3>Upgraded (2024)</h3>
				<p>Generic romantic unfunny comedy.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="the-boy-and-the-heron">
				<h3>The Boy and the Heron (2024)</h3>
				<p>This movie is a personal journey through relationship of the author (and by extension an artist) with one's art using stunning visuals.
				Also parrots are absolutely cute.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="mr-and-mrs-smith">
				<h3>Mr. &and; Mrs. Smith (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Fun romantic commedy with some action and good acting.
				In love with the main cast, story and structure.
				Therapy episode as always are the best.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="the-beekeeper">
				<h3>The Beekeeper (2024)</h3>
				<p>This movie is so interesting. The cultic approach to synthesis of outside of system cop
        with a few bad apples is so interesting. Jason Statham in this movie is not just his usual
        normal-job but killer guy - he is a prophet of a bee ideology that utilizes agents above the
        system to preserve it and throw away bad apples - like bees kill queen when she stops beeing
        good for a hive. The politics of this movie are fascinating, beeing a radical form of
        system preservation, redical centrism of sorts. I love Jason Statham normal jobs are for killing
				people universe.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="percy-jackson">
				<h3>Percy Jackson and the Olympians (s01, 2024)</h3>
				<p>Not a failure, but a dissapointement. Despite the superb casting, the execution is flawed.
        Most of the characters are washed up version or sometimes meme version of themselves -
        Annabeth is mostly Percy future love interest, Ares is pathetic goofball and the only flaw
        in casting - Dionysus is just garbage comedic relief that is played in the same way that
        Jason Mantzoukas plays all his other characters (the damage he has done to TV will not be
				forgiven).</p>

				<p>Writing issues continue to the pacing of the show, which feels like recap of the first book
        that you find on YouTube with generated voice narrating it. The only stakes are when we need
				to make a cliffhanger to the next episode, between it we just wait for something to happen.</p>

				<p>It is not a bad TV series, it's a comfort watch, especially for those that have nostalgia for
        the books (or Percy-Annabeth shippers, she says the word!). It just dissapointing, especially
        for a person like me that loves the adaptations of the works of Neil Gaiman and has seen how
				interesting TV series based on mythology coexisting with our era can be.</p>
