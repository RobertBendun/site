My first Deadly Assault!
This mode not only is fun but also is quite difficult, giving a lot of room for skill expression.
Of which I have little to none, especially when I have half baked teams.

I'm especially curious about Piper, Burince, Lucy team - how much is my low investemnt into artifacts and how much is to my lack of experience and abilities.
I hope it's the latter because the team feels quite complete.

Yixuan teams is just incomplete, Miyabi one close to perfection.
