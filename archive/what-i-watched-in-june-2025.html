			<p>and a bunch of seasons of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia but I don't feel like going season by season with this one.
			Full retroperspective will be a separate post. (can I call it a retroperspective it is still ongoing?)</p>

			<p>There is also new season of Rick and Morty.
			I was putting it off but I watched all the released episodes at the end of June and watching regulary from now on.
			It's mostly boring.</p>

			<p>And I almost forgot about Ironheart! First 3 episode were great, I'm looking forward to the ending.</p>

			<p>First time watching it in cinema and me and my friend had a great time!
			I've always watched it alone and sharing this beautiful experience made my day.
			I love how silly this movie is, going into comedic tones further then anyone would suspect while still treating itself sometimes seriously.</p>

			<p>One of the best superhero movies of all time.</p>

				<div class="score">8/10</div>
			</div>


			<p>I went to this one to relax with my girlfriend and we got what we hoped for.
			Pretty modern fairy tale that can be discussed deeper but doesn't need to - you can just enjoy the show and the beauty on the screen.</p>

			<p>Surprisingly modern with the plethora of meta humor.
			Good laugh but after a while it starts to drag a bit.</p>

				<h2><span title="watched at home">üì∫</span> Fresh Off the Boat season 1 (2015)</h2>
				<div class="score">5/10</div>
			</div>

			<p>Just another generic sitcom.</p>

			<p>It's in space between having a heart and just pretending to have one for me,
			with some of the humour being forced and with a lot of story arcs predictable.
			It would be nice to watch after work on TV but in the age of media overconsumption we got too much alternatives to continue this one.</p>

			<p>Maybe one day while doing the dishes or dinner I will get back to it.
			For now I have so much seasons of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia before me to consider going for season two.</p>

				<div class="score">-/10</div>
			</div>

			<p>This movie is so well copied from the animation that after a while when I think about motives or scenes from either the live action or the animated version I mostly see the mix of both with a few exceptions.</p>

			<p>I would say that this is a proof that we don't need live action remakes - since even when you have ability to do it well, like with this one, you just reproduce something that already exists.
			If you don't plan to reinvent neither story nor visuals then why spend resources to do it?
			That's also why I refuse to give it a score - it doesn't feel like a separate work.</p>

			<p>This movie only made me appreciate the original animation even more.
			And I would prefer to just have the original screened in cinemas again.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B413cZ5-b7Y" target="_blank">Johnny Depp is an abuser</a> that I'm glad isn't present in the public as much as he was before.
			However movies are still collaborative work and worth discussing - <em>only when</em> we remember to not promote ones that poison the art.
			And in this case he isn't the star of the show for me - Barbossa, played by Geoffrey Rush, is the core of this movies for me.</p>

			<p>I'm impressed how fresh, unconventional and light this movie is (both as a Disney movie and as a action/adventure movie).
			There is no main antagonist that we need to beat, no holy grail to get.
			It's just some players in well constructed world that we watch cross each other paths.
			The only aspect that I felt is a bit missing is fights at open sea - something that sequels provide fortunately.</p>

			<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto min-content; align-items: center">
				<h2 id="status-quo"><span title="watched at home">üì∫</span> Captain America: Brave New World (2025)</h2>
				<div class="score">4/10</div>
			</div>

			<p>There is a contradiction at the core of this movie: Capitan America - a soldier or a hero.
			Instead of confronting this contradiction, this movie chooses to ignore it which spoils the whole experience.
			It's a movie that avoids confrontation to live in a blissful ignorance.</p>

			<p>While watching this movie, I didn't see Captain America, the symbol (which he was in Falcon and Winter Soldier series).
			I see high tech soldier fighting in the interests of United States that can make an exception for one of his friends.
			Which goes not too well to be honest - saving Isaiah Bradley seems just like a plot excuse and not a real storyline.
			What I find unforgivable is the death sentence threat that when reverted just disappears.
			Apparently some people deserve to die for their actions, while others, like Red Hulk are sent to high tech prisons.
			It can be viewed as meta-commentary but this only paints Sam Wilson as complicit soldier.</p>

			<p>It's sad to see that after the series that engaged with racial injustice this one just blindly replicates it.</p>

			<p><strong>The issue with mid Marvel movies is that they expose what's normally hidden.</strong>
			When you have trouble engaging with the story you start to see the cracks.</p>

			<p>Go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpGqK9y__qg" target="_blank">Team America World Police: MCU | Copaganda Episode 6</a> by Skip Intro.</p>

			<h3>Execution</h3>

			<p>Idea behind this movie is also pretty weird - it's a continuation of a Edward Norton ‚ÄûIncredible Hulk‚Äù movie from 2008 - same year as first Iron Man.
			Yet the Banner Hulk doesn't appear despite beeing heavly mentioned.
			This makes Capitan America feel accidental - just some superhero that happened to be nearby but could be substituted by any other hero.</p>

			<h3>But to be honest I don't care</h3>

			<p>I started to write more and more about this movie but then I realized that this is tiring.
			I feel like I watched this movie before and I've written about it before.
			It's just Marvel standard, sometimes they go below (like with Ant-Man movies), sometimes they go above.
			But the line stays in the same place and as the time goes I seem to care less and less.
			Marvel factory just delivered what everybody expected - nothing more, nothing less.</p>

				<h2 id="f4-goofy"><span title="watched at home">üì∫</span> Fantastic Four (2005)</h2>
				<div id="score">7/10</div>
			</div>

			<p>There is something about 2000s that has lead to absolutely wacky movies.
			This one isn't a exception, mixing strong comedic tone with occasional heartfelt moments.</p>

			<p>One thread that particulary moved me is the Thing transformation and it's consequences.
			I was genuinly heartbroken when his wife rejected him, first in private, next in public, right after their first moment of glory.</p>

			<p>Even though Fantastic Four first action was a case of self made mess, I see this mostly as a concious comedic choice.
			And their further actions shows true superhero dedication!
			It's always great to see superhero saving people in superhero movies (and sadly some movies forget about this).</p>

				<h2 id="f4-bizzare"><span title="watched at home">üì∫</span> Fantastic Four (2015)</h2>
				<div id="score">2/10</div>
			</div>

			<p>I'm not sure what I watched.
			It doesn't feel like a superhero movie right until the end when we switch a lever and go at light speed into generic superhero blue beam into the sky movie.
			Strong contender for worst superhero movie ever made.</p>

			<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto min-content; align-items: center">
				<h2 id="f4-shiny"><span title="watched at home">üì∫</span> 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)</h2>
				<div id="score">7/10</div>
			</div>

			<p>After the disaster of Fantastic Four (2015) it felt so good to get back to goofy 2000's.
			Swapping powers gag was nice, return of Doom was so stupid that it worked and Silver Surfer looked impressive!</p>

			<p>I only wish that this movie would spent less time drooling over Sue Storm.
			It makes otherwise light and funny movie uncomfortable and sadly not really something that I would recommend.</p>

			<p><em>Words below are directed against the TV series creators. I didn't read the books and don't know issues of the series transfer to the books.</em></p>

			<p>Only partial usage of some existing culture while avoiding the Big Questions irritates me.
			If you build your series around christian mythology, you better answer the God question of it all.
			There are traces of religion in the world - Simon is Jewish, Shadowhunters operate from the abandoned church.
			Not only that - Adam, Lilith, Garden of Eden were real - so creationism is a valid position within Mortal Instruments?</p>

			<p>I'm not requesting the series to turn into the wikia.fandom.com builder but to engage with the world that is built before characters and us,
			not just to randomly throw into it whatever gains author's interests.
			‚ÄûAll the stories are true‚Äù may be a fun start to worldbuilding but shouldn't be an excuse to leave it shallow.
			I'm not requiring philosophical debates (which to be honest I would love if done properly), just some engamenent with the sources.</p>

			<p>Interesting departure from usual Christian mythos is Edom - in show it's a realm of Hell, in our world an ancient kingdom near the Dead Sea.</p>
