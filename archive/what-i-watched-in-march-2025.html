			<h1>What I Watched in March</h1>

			<p><time datetime="2025-04-06T19:48:17+02:00">2025-04-06</time></p>

			<p>There is no better proof that my daily schedule is filled to the brim then my break from cinema.
			I was filled with hope after February that I will get back to more regular screenings or at least go to the cinema once or twice.
			Nope.</p>

			<h2>Snatch (2000)</h2>

			<p>The only movie that I watched in March.
			Not that I was watching some series or something, this is one piece of visual culture that I interacted with for the whole month that I can name.
			It's good that it's one of the better examples of it, that's for sure.</p>

			<p>This movie feels experimental and familiar at the same time - probably because it become a blueprint for others (and shares a lot with Guy Ritchie later work).
			A lot of montage or music motives occur a lot in his later work and probably can be traced to his previous music video production.</p>

			<p>What surprised me the most is the script - it feels both light and dark, discussing heavy themes with light atmosphere, convoluted but straightforward.
			Impressive mix!</p>

			<p>Jason Statham is great as always, or even better since this role has given him some emotional range and didn't relay on his performance in action - he mostly talks in this movie and that's a refreshing sight!
			However, the star that maybe shines a little bit brighter is Brad Pitt - his role as Mickey O'Neil is the most interesting performance that I've seen from him (and second best after „Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”).</p>

			<p>I tried to learn more about how Pitt's performance was received by the people it portrays.
			The one piece that I found was rather negative, inside <a href="https://www.travellerstimes.org.uk/features/irish-travellers-guy-ritchies-gentleman-i-wonder-why-my-expectations-were-so-low">positive review of representation in „The Gentleman” (2024)</a>.
			So I'm glad that Ritchie took all those years and provided some good representation for this ethnic group.</p>
			<p>While looking for the review of the representation I found out that some contemporary critics pointed out similarities to his previous movie.
			I definitely need to watch it next month!</p>

			<h2>Ordering Guy Ritchie</h2>

			<p>All the movies (and tv series) from Guy Ritchie that I watched, order from best to worst:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><a href="/cinema/#the-gentlemen">The Gentlemen (series, 2024)</a></li>
				<li>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015)</li>
				<li>Snatch (2000)</li>
				<li>Wrath of Man (2021)</li>
				<li><a href="/cinema/#gentlemen">The Gentlemen (movie, 2019)</a></li>
				<li><a href="/cinema/#ministry-of-ungentlemanly-warfere">The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024)</a></li>
				<li>Sherlock Holmes (2009)</li>
				<li>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)</li>
				<li>Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre (2023)</li>
				<li>The Covenant (2023)</li>
				<li>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017)</li>
				<li>Alladyn (2019)</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Most of what I have watched from Guy Ritchie keeps a certain quality that makes this kinds of ordering hard.
			There is one obvious placement and that's Alladyn at the bottom of the list.</p>
			<p>Places 3-6 are pretty much interchangeable - depending on my mood one could rise above the other.
			What keeps The Gentlemen (tv series edition) and The Man from U.N.C.L.E above others is the inclusion of woman.
			I absolutely adore Kaya Scodelario as a Susie Glass and I wish that more of his films would be more gender varied.</p>
